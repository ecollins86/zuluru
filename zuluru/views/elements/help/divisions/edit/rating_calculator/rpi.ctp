<p>The Rating Percentage Index is a simple system for rating teams based on their winning percentage, their opponents' winning percentage, and their opponents' opponents' winning percentage. It is commonly applied to NCAA basketball and baseball.</p>
<p>With the RPI system, ratings are re-calculated on a daily basis, taking into account the strength of each team's schedule.</p>

<p class="warning-message">NOTE: For ratings to be re-calculated, you MUST have a daily cron job set up as described in the README file.</p>
