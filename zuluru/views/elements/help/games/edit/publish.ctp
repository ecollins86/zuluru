<p>Schedules are typically created unpublished, to allow the coordinator a chance to make any required adjustments (e.g. if a particular team needs to play on a specific <?php __(Configure::read('ui.field')); ?> or at a specific time, or if there is a team matchup that needs to be guaranteed) before people see them and start making plans.</p>
<p>If games are published, they will be visible to everyone; otherwise, they will be visible only to admins and coordinators, where they will be highlighted so it's obvious that they aren't yet published.</p>
<p>A day's games can be published during the creation or edit process by checking the "publish" box, or with the "publish" link from the league schedule page.</p>
