<p>iCal is a standardized format for exchanging schedule information between applications. <?php echo ZULURU; ?> supports iCal output in a variety of ways, but perhaps the most useful is the "Personal Feed".</p>
<p>If you <?php echo $this->Html->link (__('edit your preferences', true), array('controller' => 'people', 'action' => 'preferences')); ?> to enable this, you will be able to have iCal, Google Calendar and others automatically pull your schedule, from week to week, season to season, and year to year, and keep you informed of all of your upcoming games.</p>
<p>To add your personal feed to iCal, copy the link from the iCal logo at the bottom of the main <?php echo ZULURU; ?> page. Then, go to the Calendar menu in iCal, pick Subscribe, and paste in the link.</p>
<p>To add your personal feed to Google Calendar, just click the "Add to Google Calendar" link at the bottom of the main <?php echo ZULURU; ?> page.</p>
<p class="warning-message">NOTE: Google Calendar has a bug where sometimes they just stop pulling the feed, so your calendar will stop having new games added to it. Removing and re-adding the feed doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p class="warning-message">It seems this has been reported up to a couple years ago, and not yet resolved. The more people that complain about it, the more likely it is to get fixed, so if this affects you please go to <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/static.py?page=known_issues.cs">the Google iCal issues page</a>, click the "iCal feeds are not refreshing" issue and "report" it.</p>
<p class="warning-message">To work around this problem until Google fixes it, use a slightly modified URL with Google calendar. The URL for your personal feed will end in your ID number. If you add a slash, anything after that is ignored by <?php echo ZULURU; ?>, but will make it look like a different URL to Google, so putting /a at the end will fix it, at least for a while. If that stops working, change /a to /b, and so on.</p>
