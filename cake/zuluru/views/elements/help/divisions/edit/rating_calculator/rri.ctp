<p>Rodney's Ranking Index was developed by Rodney Jacobson for use by USA Ultimate (formerly the UPA) in their tournament score reporter. It is based on college hockey's KRACH algorithm.</p>
<p>With the RRI system, ratings are re-calculated on a daily basis, taking into account the strength of each team's schedule. For example, if your first game was a loss to a low-ranked team who later prove themselves to have been initially under-estimated, the penalty for that loss will be reduced as the season progresses.</p>

<p class="warning-message">NOTE: For ratings to be re-calculated, you MUST have a daily cron job set up as described in the README file.</p>
