<p>Ken's Ratings for American College Hockey is a system devised by Ken Butler to correct shortcomings in the RPI algorithm. It is commonly applied to NCAA hockey, and is the basis for the RRI system.</p>
<p>With the KRACH system, ratings are re-calculated on a daily basis, taking into account the strength of each team's schedule. For example, if your first game was a loss to a low-ranked team who later prove themselves to have been initially under-estimated, the penalty for that loss will be reduced as the season progresses.</p>
