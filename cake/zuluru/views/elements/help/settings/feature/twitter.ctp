<p>To enable Twitter integration, you must first install two support libraries into zuluru/libs.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/themattharris/tmhOAuth">tmhOAuth</a>, you need tmhOAuth.php (renamed to tmh_oauth.php) and cacert.pem.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php">twitter-api-php</a>, you need TwitterAPIExchange.php (renamed to twitter_api_exchange.php).</p>
<p>After this, you must set the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret values.
You can obtain standard Zuluru values for these by contacting <a href="mailto:admin@zuluru.org">admin@zuluru.org</a>, or you can acquire your own.
If you want your own consumer values, log in to Twitter, then go to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps">Twitter "My Applications" page</a>, click "Create a new application", and follow the steps.</p>
