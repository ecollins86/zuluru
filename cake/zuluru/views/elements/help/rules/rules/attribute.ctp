<h4>Type: Data</h4>
<p>The ATTRIBUTE rule extracts information from the player record and returns it. The name of the attribute to be returned must be in lower case and enclosed in quotes.</p>
<p>The most common attributes to use in comparisons are gender and birthdate, but any field name in the "people" table is an option.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>ATTRIBUTE('gender')</pre>
<p>will return either <strong>Male</strong> or <strong>Female</strong>. Note that both are capitalized.</p>
