<p>When there are multiple <?php __(Configure::read('ui.fields')); ?> at a single facility, the individual <?php __(Configure::read('ui.fields')); ?> are distinguished by "number". This might be as simple as "1", "2" and "3", it might be "East" and "West", or (particularly at large multi-use facilities) it might be something more like "Soccer 1 North".</p>
<p>As this is used in a number of displays, it should be kept as succinct as possible, without loss of specificity. For example, "Soccer1N" might be sufficient instead of "Soccer 1 North". One common scheme is to number <?php __(Configure::read('ui.fields')); ?> starting with the <?php __(Configure::read('ui.field')); ?> closest to the parking lot or entrance. Remember that players can always refer to the <?php __(Configure::read('ui.field')); ?> layout diagram if they are in doubt.</p>
